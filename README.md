# JWordle

## A Desktop Java Wordle Clone

This application is a game mimicking the popular game *Wordle*. The rules are simple: you have to guess a word with the chosen number of letters. After each guess the program will respond with whether each letter is present in the word, and whether it is in the correct position. Anyone wanting to play more than one Wordle a game will use this.

I was interested in making this project because I was curious how such a simple game managed to captivate so many people, and what could be going on under the hood that made it run.
