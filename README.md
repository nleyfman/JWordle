# JWordle

## A Desktop Java Wordle Clone

This application is a game mimicking the popular game *Wordle*. The rules are simple: you have to guess a word with the chosen number of letters. After each guess the program will respond with whether each letter is present in the word, and whether it is in the correct position. Anyone wanting to play more than one Wordle a game will use this.

JWordle is more customizable than Wordle, giving the user the ability to play unlimited games, as well as change the difficulty via changing the number of guesses allowed per game. All other functionality remains, with the user being able to view statistics for all games played in the current session and to save and load the game to/from file.
